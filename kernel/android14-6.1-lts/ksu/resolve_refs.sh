# 🎯 Resolve Upstream Refs — pin vs candidate
# ======================================================
# Decides which git ref (commit SHA) each tracked upstream component
# (ReSukiSU, SukiSU-Ultra, SuSFS) should build against for this run.
#
# - RUN_MODE=Release: always use the manifest's known-good pin. Never
#   queries upstream, never builds an untested candidate.
# - RUN_MODE=Test/Warming: queries upstream's latest commit. If it
#   differs from the pin and isn't already known-bad, that becomes the
#   candidate for this run — and promote_or_report.sh decides after
#   the build whether to promote it or blacklist it.
#
# Exports (via $GITHUB_ENV) for each relevant component:
#   <COMPONENT>_REF        — the SHA to actually build against
#   CANDIDATE_<COMPONENT>  — "true" if REF is an unverified candidate
